
Implementation Steps
1. Set up Azure Data Factory:
    * Create linked services to connect to Azure Data Lake Storage and the destination storage account.
    * Develop a data pipeline with a copy activity to fetch and store the incremental snapshots.
2. Data Transformation:
    * Build Databricks notebooks for data transformation. Schedule these notebooks to run after the ingestion pipeline.
3. Establish Storage Solutions:
    * Create necessary containers or databases for storing processed data.
    * Define appropriate folder structures or schemas.
4. Power BI Configuration:
    * Connect Power BI to the storage solution.
    * Create reports and dashboards based on the processed data.
5. Testing and Validation:
    * Conduct thorough testing of the data pipeline, transformations, and dashboards to ensure data integrity and performance.
    * Validate the output against historical data to confirm accuracy.
6. Deployment and Monitoring:
    * Deploy the solution and set up monitoring dashboards to track performance and alert thresholds.

Conclusion:-
This scalable architecture leverages Azure services effectively to transition the Marketing System to a cloud-based solution, ensuring efficient daily data ingestion, processing, and accessibility for dashboarding. Regular collaboration with the MS team will be essential to refine the requirements and optimize the solution further.
